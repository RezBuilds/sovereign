# Project goal
A cookbook to convert an old laptop into a Sovereign Personal Bitcoin Node.

Easy to follow instructions to build a secure and sovereign Linux based Bitcoin node using free open source software, self-verified (non-branded/containerised), enabling the use of hardware wallets while preserving privacy of personal bitcoin addresses (& balances) when interacting with the bitcoin network.

Because external guides can be out-of-date and not actively maintained. This guide has a subheading stating the last update and a link to each official software project page for further self verification.

Think of this as a general installation guide for non-technical users.

# Why run a bitcoin node?

Inspired by [Arman The Parman](https://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/)
with a few personal additions...

1. You can maximise privacy. Connecting your bitcoin wallet to your a node means not relying on someone else's copy of the timechain data, you won't divulge your IP (your location!) nor your bitcoin addresses (and their balances). It's harder for potential attackers to even know you exist and provides protection from surveillance firms who WILL co-operate with your local ruler when it's confiscation time during the inevitable collapse of fiat.

2. You can verify if you have been paid - like checking a gold payment is real by melting it down. A bitcoin payment must register on your copy of the timechain.

3. Defend the rules of your money if there is a contentious fork - no one can force you to run Bitcoin Larry Fink's Vision, for example.

4. Be one of many cockroaches that need to be destroyed to wipe out the UTXO set (who owns what). Note: even that doesn't kill Bitcoin, Bitcoin is an idea. They'd have to kill all the Bitcoiners.

5. Help someone else run a node, or provide the infrastructure so someone else can trust you and connect to your node. Remember, being a human node is not the power to run the software but the power to choose the right software to connect to - you can be that option for people, especially those you orange pill, instead of letting them connect to a random node.

6. Enjoy peace of mind, and gain a greater appreciation for the power of Bitcoin. You'll probably end up buying more, and accumulating more girlfriends.

## HARDWARE

Bitcoin Knots [minimum requirements](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/requirements)
- Ram: 1GB
- CPU: Some ARM chipsets >1.GHz
- HDD: 650GB (however large the Bitcoin blockchain currently is.)
- Download: 500 MB/day (15 GB/month)
- Upload: 5 GB/day (150 GB/month)

Most entry level laptops should meet the above specifications. Just upgrade the existing HDD to a 2T NVMe SSD card and connect the WiFi to an unlimited broadband connection.

### Recommended Hardware Components

**Laptop**: I purchased this second hand [HP portable laptop](https://amzn.to/40uZ4ZC) from Amazon.com for $140.
- Ram: 16GB
- CPU: Intel celeron 1.1 GHz
- HDD: 64GB

**Storage Upgrade**: At time of writing the Bitcoin blockchain is around 600GB of data so you will almost certainly need to upgrade the laptops internal SSD card. The NVMe SSD I upgraded to was this [2TB SSD card](https://amzn.to/3TUmjIT) for $93.

**USB Drive**: For creating bootable Ubuntu installation media, I recommend using a [32GB USB drive](https://amzn.to/46nhQG8) with good read/write speeds.

## VERIFY & INSTALL SOFTWARE
For all Bitcoin software, itâ€™s a particularly important security step to verify the release. This is done to ensure the installation file you download has not been compromised. Follow download instructions and use gpg in the terminal as instructed.

___
# Install Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
**Estimated time: 30-45 minutes**

I installed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as it's the latest stable LTS release, providing security updates until 2029.

## Deactivate Secure-Boot
If repurposing an old Windows laptop, Deactivate Secure-Boot.

Secure boot signing authorities have made mistakes in the past ([section 3, page 2 under 'Disadvantages'](https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/what-we-do/cybersecurity/professional-resources/BootSecurityModesAndRec_20190522.pdf)). Let's verify all the software ourselves and not trust a third-party to do this for us.

1. Press the laptops power-on button then immediatly press the Function key that enters the Bios menu. For the HP Laptop I'm using it was the F2 key. [Bios key by manufacturer. ](https://gadgetmates.com/bios-key-by-manufacturer)
2. Once the system Bios has loaded, proceed to turn-off ```Secure Boot``` (usually located under the ```security``` tab), save and exit. Then turn-off the laptop.

3. On a seperate PC head over to [Ubuntu Releases](https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/ "Ubuntu releases") and download the following three files: 
   - ```Ubuntu-24.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso```
   - ```SHA256SUMS```
   - ```SHA256SUMS.gpg``` 

   Save all three files to your Downloads folder.


## Verify download signitures
Note, the slightly different commands, depending if you are on Windows or Linux.
[Reference Link](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-verify-ubuntu#2-necessary-software "Ubuntu tutorial")

### Windows10
1. Verify signatures:
   ```bash
   gpg --keyid-format long --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg SHA256SUMS.txt
   ```
2. Verify ISO file:
   ```bash
   certutil -hashFile <ISO_file_path> SHA256
   ```
Compare the output with the hash in SHA256SUMS.txt.

### Linux/MacOS
1. Verify signatures:
   ```bash
   gpg --keyid-format long --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg SHA256SUMS.txt
   ```
2. Verify ISO file:
   ```bash
   sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS 2>&1 | grep OK
   ```


## Complete install
Follow the [official](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2024/04/install-ubuntu-24-04-desktop/amp/ "https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2024/04/install-ubuntu-24-04-desktop/amp/")
installation instructions to install Ubuntu.

## Complete Ubuntu Setup
**Estimated time: 15-20 minutes**

Once Ubuntu installation has finished, complete the following setup steps:

### 1. Initial Configuration
```bash
# Update package manager
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Install Git
   sudo apt install git

# Install dependencies for Specter
   sudo add-apt-repository universe && sudo apt install libfuse2
   ```

### 2. Power Management Setup
Because you will want to run your node for 6+ hours a day (24hrs is better), configure power settings:

**GUI Settings:**
- Navigate to: Show Apps > Settings > Power Settings
- Set Power Mode = Balanced
- Set Automatic Power Saver = Off  
- Set Automatic suspend = Off

**Laptop Lid Configuration:**
```bash
# Configure laptop lid to do nothing when closed
sudo nano /etc/systemd/logind.conf
# Uncomment and set: HandleLidSwitch=ignore
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
   ```
*Note: This will log you out of Ubuntu*

Head over to [Bitcoin Knots](https://bitcoinknots.org/) and:
- Download the latest Linux(tgz) 64 bit version and save to Downloads folder
- Bitcoin Knots is a derivative of Bitcoin Core with enhanced features, more conservative policies, and additional privacy options
- Bitcoin Knots uses the same command-line interface as Bitcoin Core (bitcoin-cli, bitcoin-qt, bitcoind)
- Follow the verification instructions on the Bitcoin Knots website to verify your download using GPG signatures

## Complete install
[Reference Link](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#linux-instructions "Bitcoin.org")

1. Extract Bitcoin Knots:
   ```bash
   tar xzf bitcoin-28.1.knots20250305-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
   ```
2. Install Bitcoin Knots:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads && sudo rm -r bitcoin-28.1.knots20250305-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
   ```

---
## Run Bitcoin Knots (start initial blockchain download)
**Estimated time: 3-7 days (initial sync)**

1. Start Bitcoin Knots:
   ```bash
   bitcoin-qt
   ``` 
   You will be greated with the Bitcoin Knots Welcome screen.

2. Uncheck ```Limit block chain storage```. We want to download the complete Bitcoin blockchain from the genisis block.
3. Click ```OK```.

Bitcoin Knots will now create the main ```data-directory``` in a hidden folder .bitcoin inside your home directory. It is here that all Bitcoin Knots configuaration files will be stored along with the complete blockchain data. Get familiar with this ```data-directory``` (home/USERNAME/.bitcoin) location as we will be accessing it again later.

4. Leave the laptop power plugged in and wait for the Bitcoin blockchain to download, Bitcoin Knots will show a % complete and a rough estimate of how much time remains until completion.


---
## Configure Bitcoin Knots
1. Once Bitcoin Knots is fully synced you will be greeted with a welcome screen asking if you would like to ```Create a new wallet```. Proceed to create a standard wallet. 

2. Then edit Bitcoin Knots config file.

3. From the Bitcoin Knots GUI click on ```Settings```, ```Options```, then ```Open Configuration File```.

4. Enter the below text, save and exit
   ```bash
   # server=1, this tells Bitcoin to accept JSON-RPC commands 
   # (such as ones from EPS or Electrs etc.). txindex=1 allows any transaction 
   # to be looked up by EPS, this flag is not required for Electrs.
   server=1
   txindex=1
   listen=1

   proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
   bind=127.0.0.1

   datadir=

   # only connect to Tor hidden services, not even IPv4/IPv6 nodes
   onlynet=onion
  
   # Electrs can use the .cookie setting to connect to Bitcoin Knots
   # but Specter can not and requires the rpcuser/rpcpassword to be set.
   rpcuser=<User>
   rpcpassword=<Password>
   
   # If running tor, walletbroadcast=0 prevents the node from 
   # rebroadcasting transactions without tor.
   walletbroadcast=0
   
5. Now shut down Bitcoin Knots so that the config changes we made can be applied. Click on the ```X``` in the top right hand corner. Or enter the below command in any Terminal window:
   ```bash
   bitcoin-cli stop
   ```
## Allow incoming connections (optional but recommended)
Configure your WIFI router to allow Bitcoin Knots incoming connections on port:8332. Make a note of both your MAC and IP address then follow the instructions in this [Link](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#network-configuration)

Retrieve your Laptops MAC address and IP address from the Terminal. 

1. Get MAC address:
   ```bash
   ip link
   ```
   Look for `link/ether=##:##:##:##:##:##` in the output.

2. Get IP address:
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```
## Some other helpful commands
3. Install net-tools:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install net-tools
   ```
4. Check Bitcoin connections:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat --ip -lpa|grep bitcoin
   ```

## Switching Between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots

You can easily switch between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots:
- Both use the same data directory (~/.bitcoin)
- Both use identical configuration files
- Simply install the other version and replace the binaries
- No need to re-download the blockchain

# Install Tor
**Estimated time: 10-15 minutes**
**Last updated: July 2025**
[Official website](https://support.torproject.org/apt/tor-deb-repo/)

"Browse Privately. Explore Freely.
Defend yourself against tracking and surveillance. Circumvent censorship." - Torproject.org

1. Check CPU architecture:
   ```bash
   dpkg --print-architecture
   ```
2. Install apt-transport-https:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https
   ```
3. Check Linux distribution:
   ```bash
   lsb_release -c
   ```
4. Create Tor repository file:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
   ```
5. Edit tor.list:
   ```bash
   sudo nano tor.list
   ```
6. Add repository entries:
   ```bash
   deb     [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org noble main
   deb-src [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org noble main
   ```
7. Add Tor GPG key:
   ```bash
   sudo wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
   ```
8. Update package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
9. Install Tor:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
   ```
10. Verify installation:
    ```bash
    tor --version
    ```
11. Enable auto-start (optional):
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable tor
    ```

## Tor Systemctl commands
1. Restart Tor:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart tor
   ```
2. Check status:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status tor
   ```

---
## Set up Tor hidden service
Configure Bitcoin Knots to only connect using Tor. [Reference link](
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Setting_up_a_Tor_hidden_service)

Additional video tutorial, for further reference: [Canadian Bitcoiners](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goTkOt8Rr1Q&list=PLZqQw4mLW-r3UEyL12FG4koZq6lOLsURF&index=3)

1. Edit Tor config:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/tor
   ```
2. Edit torrc:
   ```bash
   sudo nano torrc
   ```
3. Add configuration:
   ```bash
   ControlPort 9051
   CookieAuthentication 1
   CookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1
   ```
4. Find Bitcoin user:
   ```bash
   ps -eo user,group,comm |egrep 'bitcoind|bitcoin-qt' |awk '{print "Bitcoin user: " $1}'
   ```
5. Add user to Tor group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor <user name found from above command>
   ```
6. Check Tor groups (if needed):
   ```bash
   getent group
   ```
   
The above configuration sets up an automatic hidden service that is initiated by Bitcoin Knots. On the next startup of bitcoin, Bitcoin Knots will generate a file called ```onion_private_key``` in the data directory. KEEP THIS SAFE. If someone copies this file they can run a server with your .onion address. While a malicious party cannot necessarily associate the server with you as a person, as long as your server has the same xxxx.onion address they will know it is run by the same person.

If you delete this file, the next time bitcoind loads it will generate a new key file and xxxxxxxx.onion address.  For absolute security delete your ```onion_private_key``` file at each reboot or some frequent interval.

7. Do a system Restart
   ```bash
   sudo shutdown -r now
   ```

## Verify Bitcoin Knots is using Tor
1. Verify Tor connection:
   ```bash
   bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo
   ```
2. Look for the networks section in the output. Your node is running behind Tor if you see these settings:
   ```
   "name": "ipv4",
         "limited": true,
         "reachable": false

   And

   "name": "onion",
         "limited": false,
         "reachable": true
   ```
   This confirms that IPv4 is disabled and only Tor (onion) connections are active.

   # DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY - COPY IT FIRST!
   # If you edit this, you will cry a lot during update and will not want to live anymore!
   
   # This is an EXAMPLE of how configuration file should look like.
   # Do NOT blindly copy this and expect it to work for you!
   # If you don't know what you're doing consider using automated setup or ask an experienced friend.
   
   # This example contains only the most important settings.
   # See docs or electrs man page for advanced settings.

   # Use the below auth="USER:PASSWORD if you have RPC user:password set/active
   # in bitcoin.conf file.
   auth="<User>:<Password>"

   # The listening RPC address of bitcoind, port is usually 8332
   daemon_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:8332"
   
   # The listening P2P address of bitcoind, port is usually 8333
   daemon_p2p_addr = "127.0.0.1:8333"
   
   # Directory where the index should be stored. It should have at least 70GB of free space.
   db_dir = "/home/<User>/electrs/db"
   
   # bitcoin means mainnet. Don't set to anything else unless you're a developer.
   network = "bitcoin"
   
   # The address on which electrs should listen. Warning: 0.0.0.0 is probably a bad idea!
   # Tunneling is the recommended way to access electrs remotely.
   electrum_rpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:50001"
   
   # How much information about internal workings should electrs print. Increase before reporting a bug.
   log_filters = "INFO"

   ```
## Build Electrs server index
6. Check Bitcoin data size:
   ```bash
   du -ch ~/.bitcoin/blocks/blk*.dat | tail -n1
   ```
   This will print the size of the existing Bitcoin Knots block directory. The final Electrs index DB will be about 10-20% the size of the Bitcoin Knots block directory.

7. Start Bitcoind and wait for bitcoind to complete initial sync.
   ```bash
   bitcoind -server -daemon
   ```

8. Check sync status:
   ```bash
   bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo | head
   ```
   
9. Start Electrs initial sync. **First sync can take 1-2 days depending on CPU/hardware.**
   ```bash
   electrs --log-filters INFO
   ```
10. Check Electrs DB size:
   ```bash
   du ~/electrs/db
   ```
